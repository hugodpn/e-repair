E-REPAIR

This is a final work of university course.

In order to satisfy the requirements about a functional application with reports,
configurations, internationalizations and security module I created a little application
to register the repairs of equipments  in some institution (eg a hospital).

Some points interested to see are:
- The security authentication with authlogic
- The way that the user restore the password using a gmail account.
- The permissions handle with acts_as_permissible
- The internationalizations
- Some unit test with rspec
- The logic to register one repair

This system can be changed to adapt at your necessity. Can be a good point to start.

If you want to contact me you can send me an email to hugodpn@yahoo.com.ar and I hope help you.
